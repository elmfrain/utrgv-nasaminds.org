Plants are critical for our survival, for they provide oxygen and food - both scarce beyond Earth. However, farming them using traditional methods don't hold up in space. Therefore, we created the **Hydroponic System**. Our solution automatically farms and maintains crops without using dirt. The clever robotic mechanism feeds the crops with water and a perfect blend of nutrients, yet little maintenence is on the system is needed.
